## Logo

**Always ask for a logo before building.** Ask:
> "Do you have a logo for this product/app/idea? If yes, share the file (PNG, SVG, JPG) or describe it. If no, I'll create a text-based or SVG logo using the product name and brand colors."

- If provided: place in this folder, use in navbar (top-left, 28–36px), hero (optional), and footer (muted, 20–24px)
- If not provided: create a clean SVG wordmark using the product name, brand color, and a premium font from the active SKILL.md
- Never stretch or distort the logo — always preserve aspect ratio

## Design Skills

This project uses layered design skills:
- **SKILL.md** — Active style skill (visual direction)
- **.impeccable.md** — Design quality, anti-patterns, and accessibility
- For page structure, hero formulas, and conversion patterns, also follow `../../skills/landing-page-design/patterns.md`, `../../skills/landing-page-design/anti-patterns.md`, and `../../skills/landing-page-design/decisions.md`
- For animation and interaction implementation, also follow `../../skills/emil-design-eng/SKILL.md`

## Output

All generated files must stay in this folder.
