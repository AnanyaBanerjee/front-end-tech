# Project Rules

## ⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE: Every Page Follows All Four Standards

**Every `.html` file in `site/` — index.html, privacy-policy.html, terms.html, dmca.html, any subpage — must comply with ALL FOUR standards. No exceptions.**

| Standard | Must have on every page |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Security** | SRI on CDN scripts, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links, no secrets in source |
| **Legal** | Same navbar + footer with copyright, links to Privacy Policy / Terms / DMCA, `noai` meta tag |
| **SEO** | `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph tags, semantic HTML, image alt attributes *(skip OG on legal pages)* |
| **AEO** | `llms.txt` exists, factual headlines, no marketing speak in descriptions |

If unsure whether a rule applies — apply it. Default to more protection, not less.

## Folder Structure

All deployable files go inside `site/`. Skill files stay at the project root.

```
output/<project-name>/
├── SKILL.md          ← style skill (do not deploy)
├── .impeccable.md    ← quality layer (do not deploy)
├── CLAUDE.md         ← these rules (do not deploy)
└── site/             ← DEPLOY THIS to Cloudflare Pages
    ├── index.html
    ├── logo.svg
    ├── llms.txt
    ├── robots.txt
    ├── sitemap.xml
    └── images/
        └── screenshot-1.png
```

Never create HTML, images, or assets outside of `site/`. Never put SKILL.md or CLAUDE.md inside `site/`.

## Universal Rule: Security + Legal on Every Single Page

**Every `.html` file in `site/` — without exception — must follow both security and legal guidelines.**

This includes index.html, privacy-policy.html, terms.html, dmca.html, and any other page ever created.

Security on every page:
- `integrity` + `crossorigin="anonymous"` on every CDN script and stylesheet
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on every `target="_blank"` link
- No API keys, email addresses, or sensitive data in source code

Legal on every page:
- Same navbar (logo links to `/`)
- Same footer with copyright: `© [year] [Owner]. All rights reserved. [Product]™`
- Same footer links to Privacy Policy, Terms, and DMCA
- Same fonts, colors, spacing, and animations as index.html

Legal pages only (privacy-policy.html, terms.html, dmca.html):
- Add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`
- Do NOT add Open Graph, Twitter card, or JSON-LD tags

When in doubt — apply the rule. Default to more protection, not less.

## Logo

**Always ask for a logo before building.** Ask:
> "Do you have a logo for this product/app/idea? If yes, share the file (PNG, SVG, JPG). If no, I'll create a clean SVG wordmark."

- Save logo as `site/logo.svg` (and `site/logo-light.svg` for dark backgrounds)
- Use in navbar (top-left, 28–36px), footer (muted, 20–24px)
- Never stretch or distort — preserve aspect ratio

## Product Images

**Always ask for screenshots before building.** Ask:
> "Do you have screenshots or images of your product? If yes, share them and I'll present them beautifully. If no, I'll create a placeholder."

- Save all images inside `site/images/`
- Reference in HTML as `images/filename.png` (relative path, no leading slash)

## Design Skills

- **Logo**: follow `../../skills/logo/SKILL.md`
- **Branding**: follow `../../skills/branding/patterns.md` and `anti-patterns.md`
- **Product images**: follow `../../skills/product-images/SKILL.md`
- **SKILL.md** — active style skill (visual direction)
- **.impeccable.md** — design quality, anti-patterns, accessibility
- **Structure**: follow `../../skills/landing-page-design/patterns.md`, `anti-patterns.md`, `decisions.md`
- **Engineering**: follow `../../skills/emil-design-eng/SKILL.md`
- **Sync**: follow `../../skills/sync/SKILL.md` — after every change, check cascade map and update all affected files
- **Legal**: follow `../../skills/legal/SKILL.md` — ask for existing legal docs first, improve or generate privacy policy, terms, and DMCA
- **Security**: follow `../../skills/security/SKILL.md` — apply to every page; site/_headers already stubbed
- **SEO**: follow `../../skills/seo/SKILL.md` — apply full checklist to every page
- **AEO**: follow `../../skills/aeo/SKILL.md` — generate `site/llms.txt` for every project
- **Copy**: follow `../../skills/copywriting/SKILL.md`

## Deployment

When the project is ready, remind the user:
> "To deploy: go to pages.cloudflare.com, create a project, and upload the `site/` folder. See `how_to_deploy.md` at the repo root for full instructions including custom domain setup."
