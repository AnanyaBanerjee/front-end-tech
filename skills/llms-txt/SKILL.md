# LLMs.txt and Agent Search Optimization Skill

## Rule: Apply to Every Project by Default

AI search engines are now a major discovery channel. Every landing page or website built using this repo must include `llms.txt` and follow AEO (Agent Engine Optimization) principles without being asked.

---

## 1. What is llms.txt?

`llms.txt` is a plain text file placed at the root of your website — like `robots.txt` but for AI agents. It tells LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) exactly what your product is, who it's for, and where to find the most important information.

Without it, AI agents have to guess by scraping your HTML — they often get it wrong or miss the key points entirely.

---

## 2. Generate llms.txt

**File location:** Create `llms.txt` inside the project's output subfolder alongside `index.html` — e.g., `output/my-project/llms.txt`. When deployed, this file must sit at the root of the website (`yoursite.com/llms.txt`), which is why it belongs at the root of the project folder, not in the repo root.

Always ask the user these questions before generating, or infer from context:

1. What is the product called?
2. What does it do in one sentence?
3. Who is it for?
4. What is the main URL?
5. What are the 3–5 most important pages or sections?

Then create `/llms.txt` at the project root:

```markdown
# [Product Name]

> [One sentence: what it does and who it's for.]

[2-3 sentences of additional context: key features, platform, pricing model, and what makes it different.]

## Key Pages

- [Home](https://yoursite.com/): Overview and main value proposition

## 3. AI Meta Tags

Add these to your HTML `<head>` alongside regular SEO tags. These help AI crawlers understand your product faster:

```html
<!-- Tells AI crawlers what this page is about in plain language -->
<meta name="description" content="[Factual, specific description. Avoid marketing words like 'revolutionary' or 'seamless'. State what it does and who uses it.]" />

<!-- Helps AI understand content type -->
<meta name="category" content="[e.g. Productivity, Developer Tool, Mobile App, SaaS]" />

<!-- Explicit permission for AI training and indexing -->
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />

<!-- For AI agents specifically — allow crawling -->
<meta name="googlebot" content="index, follow" />
```

### What NOT to write in descriptions (AI gets confused by these):
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "next-generation" — meaningless to LLMs
- "Seamless", "powerful", "robust" — overused, no signal value
- Rhetorical questions ("Tired of X?") — AI can't cite questions as facts
- Hyperbole ("The best app ever") — LLMs distrust unverifiable superlatives

### What TO write instead:
- Specific capabilities: "Connects to any A2A-compatible AI agent via URL"
- Specific audience: "Built for developers who need to test AI agents"
- Specific platform: "Native iOS and macOS app, no account required"
- Specific differentiator: "Streams responses without storing conversation data"

## 4. Page Copy Principles for AI Search

AI search engines summarize and cite your page copy directly. Write every section with this in mind:

### Headlines
- State what the thing is, not how it makes you feel
- ✅ "Connect to any AI agent via URL"
- ❌ "The future of AI communication"

### Feature descriptions
- Lead with the capability, then the benefit
- ✅ "Real-time streaming — responses appear as the agent generates them, no waiting for the full reply"
- ❌ "Experience the magic of instant AI responses"

### About / How it works sections
- Write in factual, encyclopedic language
- Imagine Wikipedia writing about your product — that's the tone AI will use to cite you
- Include specific details: protocol names, platform names, pricing model, technical constraints

### FAQ sections
- FAQs are gold for AI search — LLMs love to cite Q&A directly
- Write questions the way users actually ask them in search/chat
- Keep answers factual, specific, and under 100 words each

## 5. Structured Data for AI

Add `speakable` schema to mark the most citable parts of your page — AI assistants use this to find the best text to read aloud or summarize:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": ["h1", ".hero-description", ".product-summary"]
  },
  "name": "[Product Name]",
  "description": "[Factual one-sentence description]",
  "url": "https://yoursite.com"
}
</script>
```

Add the class `product-summary` to the paragraph that best summarizes what your product does — this is what AI will quote.
