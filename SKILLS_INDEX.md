# Skills Index

A routing guide for Claude. Use this to determine which skills apply, in what order, and under what conditions — without reading every SKILL.md file first.

---

## Build Sequence (follow this order every time)

```
PHASE 1 — Before writing any code
  1. logo/SKILL.md         ← ask for logo (or create SVG wordmark)
  2. product-images/SKILL.md ← ask for screenshots (or create placeholder)
  3. impeccable/SKILL.md [teach] ← gather design context (.impeccable.md)

PHASE 2 — Choose one style skill
  → see Style Skill Routing below

PHASE 3 — Build the page
  Mandatory on EVERY page, no exceptions:
  4. security/SKILL.md     ← _headers, SRI on CDN scripts, safe links
  5. legal/SKILL.md        ← copyright, privacy policy, terms, DMCA, noai
  6. seo/SKILL.md          ← title, meta, OG tags, JSON-LD, semantic HTML
  7. aeo/SKILL.md          ← llms.txt, speakable schema, factual copy, FAQ

PHASE 4 — After any change
  8. sync/SKILL.md         ← propagate changes across all affected files
```

## Style Skill Routing

Pick exactly ONE style skill per project. Never mix two style skills on the same site.

| User signals | Use this skill |
|---|---|
| "modern SaaS", "React app", "dashboard", wants motion | `taste-skill/SKILL.md` |
| "luxury", "agency-level", "Awwwards", "cinematic", high-end branding | `soft-skill/SKILL.md` |
| "minimal", "editorial", "clean", "Notion-like", "document-style" | `minimalist-skill/SKILL.md` |
| "brutalist", "raw", "industrial", "terminal", "tactical", "bold typography" | `brutalist-skill/SKILL.md` |
| User asks for animation review, motion QA, or "make this feel right" | `emil-design-eng/SKILL.md` |
| No clear preference | Default to `taste-skill/SKILL.md` |

**Note:** `soft-skill` produces React/Next.js. `minimalist-skill` and `brutalist-skill` work with plain HTML/CSS. `taste-skill` defaults to React but can adapt.

## All Skills — Quick Reference

### Mandatory (apply to every project, every page)

| Skill | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Security | `skills/security/SKILL.md` | `_headers` for Cloudflare, SRI `integrity` + `crossorigin` on all CDN tags, no secrets in source, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links, honeypot on forms |

### Pre-build (run before any visual work)

| Skill | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Logo | `skills/logo/SKILL.md` | Ask for logo → handle file, OR create SVG wordmark. Covers navbar/hero/footer placement. |
| Product Images | `skills/product-images/SKILL.md` | Ask for screenshots → present beautifully (browser frame, phone, floating, tilt, layered). Placeholder if none. |
| Impeccable (teach) | `skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` | Gather design context into `.impeccable.md`. Required before any style skill produces output. |

### Style (pick one per project)

### Post-change (run after every edit)

| Skill | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Sync | `skills/sync/SKILL.md` | Detects what changed, maps cascade of affected files, presents sync plan, applies after confirmation. |

### Content reference (consult when writing copy or brand)

| Skill | Files | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Copywriting | `skills/copywriting/SKILL.md` | Consolidated: awareness levels, all frameworks (PAS/AIDA/BAB/PASTOR/4U), psychology triggers, social proof hierarchy, objection handling, CTA rules, scoring rubric, slash commands, industry guidance for tech/entertainment/motivation |

## Common Scenarios

**"Build me a landing page for X"**
→ Phase 1 questions (logo? screenshots?) → teach mode → pick style skill → build with all 4 mandatory standards → sync

**"Add a new page to my site"**
→ Copy navbar + footer from `index.html` → apply all 4 mandatory standards → add to `sitemap.xml` → sync

**"I updated the navbar"**
→ `sync/SKILL.md` — cascade to all other `.html` files

**"I changed the product name"**
→ `sync/SKILL.md` — update all `<title>` tags, `llms.txt`, Open Graph titles, footer copyright, `terms.html` and `privacy-policy.html` body text

**"I changed the domain URL"**
→ `sync/SKILL.md` — update `robots.txt` Sitemap URL, all `<loc>` in `sitemap.xml`, all canonical tags, all `og:url` tags, `llms.txt` links

**"I added a new CDN script or stylesheet"**
→ `security/SKILL.md` — add `integrity` + `crossorigin="anonymous"` to the tag, add the domain to `_headers` CSP `script-src` or `style-src`

**"I added analytics"**
→ `security/SKILL.md` — add analytics domain to `_headers` CSP
→ `legal/SKILL.md` — update `privacy-policy.html` third-party services section

**"Review my animations"**
→ `emil-design-eng/SKILL.md`

**"The legal pages look different from the main site"**
→ `legal/SKILL.md` — read `index.html` first, copy exact `<head>`, navbar, footer, colors, fonts, and animations

**"Add a FAQ section"**
→ `aeo/SKILL.md` — direct, citable answers, no marketing speak, use FAQPage JSON-LD schema

**"Is everything consistent / up to date?"**
→ `sync/SKILL.md` with argument "all" — full project audit against all files and standards
